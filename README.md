# datadog
attended 2025 datadog datapups summit, where opportunities such as resume reviews, interview preparation, and a hackathon were offered. for the hackathon, we were tasked with adding functionalities to the python code they initially provided us (datadog.py). this is a command-line applicaation that helps a user track their spending habits. the only functionalities that came with the applicaiton initially were adding a category and a budget for it, adding a value spent toward a category, showing a summary in a list format, and saving and exiting the run. during my 45 minutes, i added the abilitiy to remove a category, issuing warnings if a user was going to exceed their budget, and printing out the summary in a table among others. front-end for this to come.
